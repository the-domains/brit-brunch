Roebling Tea Room is probably one of my favorite brunch spots in Williamsburg. It combines delightfully hipster decoration with delicious food. Despite their name they sadly have pared back their tea selection in recent years.

If you're hungover then go for the potato sandwich and start feeling human again in no time. The smoked salmon toast and baked eggs are also good choices for those who maybe partied a bit less the night before.

Beware the apple pancake - whilst delicious it is so huge that two people would have trouble finishing it.
