This is a winter favorite of mine. A classic Canadian/Jewish deli with an extensive selection of dishes mostly consisting of smoked meats.

For sandwich lovers you can't go wrong with the reuben or smoked brisket, but the real draw is the poutine. Bulbous cheese curds melted over fries, paired with more of the aforementioned smoked meats and covered in gravy.
