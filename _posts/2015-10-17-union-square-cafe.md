Where Danny Meyer's empire began, an awkward space off Union Square. 

These were without a doubt the best poached eggs I've ever had - they were soft and runny, perfectly cooked over a delicious tomato, pepper and olive base. 

The beer wasn't bad either - a decently sized selection of obscure beers. I went with the Westbrook White Thai beer. A delightful take on the wheat beer, combined with lemongrass and ginger reminiscent of the flavors of South East Asian cuisine.
