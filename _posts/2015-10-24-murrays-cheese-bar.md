As a cheese lover I really wanted to try brunch at Murray's. Thankfully I was not disappointed - the farmers breakfast is a treat. A delightfully hearty pairing of fried egg, salami and a selection of cheeses. This is a great way to start the day.

Also of note are the mimosa flights consisting of three flavors - orange, guava and blood orange. 

If you happen to visit in the evening then go for the buffalo cheese curds pairs with the fondue!
