I have to admit that I was intrigued by Soylent - could this thing really replace food? null

The answer is no, but it really isn't too terrible. Think of it as a protein shake, great for when you are too busy to eat or want to skip breakfast. 

It has a slightly chalky taste which can be enhanced with a few drops of vanilla extract.
