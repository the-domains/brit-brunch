Another Danny Meyer spot, the original outpost in Madison Square Park is perfect for an outdoor brunch (or any other occasion)!

Generally I tend to gravitate towards the Shack Stack - a Shack Burger paired with a deep fried portobello mushroom which has been stuffed with cheeses. Every bite probably takes a few months off you're life but I'd argue that its worth it.

Recently a few other items have appeared on the menu. The Roadside Burger (cheeseburger with caramelized onions and bacon bits) is great if you want a more simple, savory bite. 

Avoid the Park Burger though (burger with melted cows cheese and bacon) - it sounds like a good idea, and the cheese is delicious but I found this one a little salty for my taste.

Surprisingly the shack serves really good wine, provided by the Napa-based Frogs Leap Vineyard. It's a great pairing though if you go for the full bottle then it may invite strange looks from the crowds of tourists!
